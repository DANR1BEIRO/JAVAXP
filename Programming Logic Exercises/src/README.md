__PROGRAMMING LOGIC EXERCISES__

- [x] 1 - Create an algorithm that receives three values: A, B and C; then, print the
sum of A and B, and check if the sum is smaller than C.

- [x] 2 - Create an algorithm to receive any number and print whether the number is even or odd, positive or negative.

- [x] 3 - Create an algorithm that reads two integer values A and B. If the values of A and B are equal, it should add the
two values; otherwise, it should multiply A by B. At the end of either calculation, the result should be assigned to a 
variable C and printed on the screen.

- [x] 4 - Create an algorithm that receives an integer and prints its predecessor and successor on the screen.

- [x] 5 - Create an algorithm that reads the value of the minimum wage and the salary of a user, calculates how many 
minimum wages the user earns, and prints the result on the screen. (Base for the minimum wage: R$ 1,293.20).

- [x] 6 - Create an algorithm that reads any value and prints it on the screen with a 5% adjustment.

- [x] 7 - Create an algorithm that reads two boolean (logical) values and determines if both are TRUE or FALSE.

- [x] 8 - Create an algorithm that reads three different integer values and prints them in descending order.

- [x] 9 - Create an algorithm that calculates a person's BMI (Body Mass Index), reads their weight and height, and prints 
their condition on the screen according to the table below:

BMI Formula:
BMI = weight(kg) / height(m2)ex17

BMI Conditions Table:

    Below 18.5: Underweight
    Between 18.6 and 24.9: Ideal weight (congratulations)
    Between 25.0 and 29.9: Slightly overweight
    Between 30.0 and 34.9: Obesity Grade I
    Between 35.0 and 39.9: Obesity Grade II (severe)
    Greater than or equal to 40: Obesity Grade III (morbid)

- [x] 10 - Create an algorithm that reads three grades obtained by a student and 
prints the average of the grades on the screen.

- [x] 11 - Create an algorithm that reads four grades obtained by a student, calculates the average of the grades, 
and prints the student's name and whether they passed or failed. To be considered passed,
the student's final average must be greater than or equal to 7.

- [x] 12 - Create an algorithm that reads the value of a product and determines the amount to 
be paid based on the buyer's chosen payment method. Print the final amount to be paid on the 
screen. Use the payment condition codes from the table below to calculate the appropriate amount.

Payment Condition Codes Table:
1 - Cash or Pix: 15% discount
2 - Credit card (one-time payment): 10% discount
3 - Credit card (two installments): Normal product price, no interest
4 - Credit card (three or more installments): Normal product price plus 10% interest

- [x] 13 - Create an algorithm that reads a person's name and age and prints 
- their name and whether they are a minor or an adult.

- [x] 14 - Create an algorithm that receives two values, A and B, swaps the value 
- of A with B and the value of B with A, and prints the values on the screen.

- [x] 15 - Create an algorithm that reads the year a person was born and prints how many years, months, 
- and days they have lived. Assume a year has 365 days and a month has 30 days.

(Example: 5 years, 2 months, and 15 days of life)

- [x] 16 - Create an algorithm that reads three values representing the three sides of a triangle, verifies if they are 
valid, and determines whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

- [x] 17 - Create an algorithm that reads a temperature in Fahrenheit and calculates the 
corresponding temperature in Celsius. Print both temperatures on the screen.

Formula:
F = (C * 1.8) + 32
C = (F - 32) * 5/9

- [x] 18 - Francisco is 1.50m tall and grows 2 centimeters per year, while Sara is 1.10m tall and grows 
3 centimeters per year. Create an algorithm that calculates and prints how many years 
it will take for Sara to be taller than Francisco.

- [x] 19 - Create an algorithm that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 10 on the screen.

- [x] 20 - Create an algorithm that receives an integer and prints its multiplication table on the screen.

-[] 21 - Create an algorithm that shows a random value between 0 and 100.

-[] 22 - Create an algorithm that reads two integer values A and B and 
prints the quotient and remainder of the integer division between them.

-[] 23 - Create an algorithm that calculates the net salary of a teacher. The provided 
information will be: the value of the hourly wage, the number of hours taught in the 
month, and the INSS discount percentage. Print the final net salary on the screen.

-[] 24 - Create an algorithm that calculates the amount of fuel consumed during a trip, 
knowing that the car does 12 km per liter. The user must provide the time spent on the trip, 
their average speed, the distance traveled, and the amount of fuel used for the trip.

Formulas:
distance=time×speed
distance=time×speed
fuel used=distance12
fuel used=12distance
