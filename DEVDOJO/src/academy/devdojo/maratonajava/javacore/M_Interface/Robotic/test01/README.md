 - Two classes (**FlyingRobot** and **SwimmingRobot**) that implement the same _interface_ and override its methods.
- A class that has a method which receives as a parameter an object whose class implements the **MoverRobot** interface, and then prints each object using its overridden methods.
- A `Main` class that instantiates the three classes and then calls the print method.
