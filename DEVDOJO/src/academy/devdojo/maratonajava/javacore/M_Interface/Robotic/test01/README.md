 - Three classes (**FlyingRobot**, **SwimmingRobot**, **LandRobot**) that implement the same _interface_ 
and override its methods.
- A class that has a method which receives as a parameter an object whose class implements the 
**Robot** interface, and then prints each object using its overridden methods.
- A `Main` class that instantiates the three classes and then calls the print method.
