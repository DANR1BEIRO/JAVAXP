**Testing abstract classes and abstract methods**

- I made an abstract class Animal with its own abstract method
- Two abstract subclasses called _Dog_ and _Cat_ with its own abstract methods
- Two concrete subclasses _Rottweiler (extends dog)_ and _StrayCat (extends Cat)_ <br>
that implemented the abstract methods from superclasses
- A main class to create two objects: Rottweiler and StrayCat
